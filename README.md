"Software is like this chocolate chip cookie. All those pastie, gooey, non-chocolotey bits are bugs, problems, and other non-quality features. We're gonna take em all out and replace them with what? QUALITY! See what happens when we add one quality? Isn't that better? I can't get enough quality, so let's add some more. And some more! Now we've got real quality!"
